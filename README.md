## [Game rules](https://www.thegamegal.com/2018/09/01/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/)
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a modification of the Tic Tac Toe, which introduces smaller boards in cells with the rules of the original game. Player can start in any of the smaller boards, and make one move in it. Then the other player must make a move in the board positioned same way as the freshly made move. For example, if the first player made a move in the board in the upper right corner in the lower left cell, the second player must now play in the board in the lower left corner. If he can't do that (the gameplay of given board has already been completed), then he can choose any board.\
If small board game has been won, then the player who won it claims square with this smaller game on the big board.\
The player who wins in the big board wins entire game.
